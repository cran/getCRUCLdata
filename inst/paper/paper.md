# Summary

The getCRUCLdata package provides two functions that automate downloading and importing CRU CL2.0 climatology data [@New2002] into R [@R-base], facilitates the calculation of minimum temperature and maximum temperature, and formats the data into a tidy data frame or a list of raster stack objects [@Raster] for use in R or easily exports to a raster format file for use in a geographic information system (GIS).
